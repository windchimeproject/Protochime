# Protochime
One-stop dive-in to the hardware aspects of Windchime

Hey! If you have not yet done so, take a look at [Dark Matter Direct Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter#Direct_detection) for some of the scientific background.

Protochime initially aims to perform a rudimentary analysis using an array of 15 accelerometers to measure the speed of sound, for example.

Here is [documentation](https://github.com/windchimeproject/Protochime/blob/ReadMeEdits/Achieving%20Best%20Noise%20Performance%20with%20ADXL1002.pdf) to serve as a reference in achieving the best performance with ADXL1002.
